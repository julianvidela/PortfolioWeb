        <p className='text-[var(--text-color-primary)] mt-3 '>
        I have 25 years old, from Buenos Aires, Argentina, and have been working in these roles for over a year. I specialize in React and enjoy getting involved in design to better connect user experience with the front-end.

        During my career, I worked remotely for a startup in Peru and currently work on freelance projects. I'm also developing a side project to help hair salons manage their appointments via WhatsApp, making scheduling easier and improving the customer experience.
